## Prompt

create new repositry name is how to earn money using ai

## Response snapshot

🔴 DECISION NEEDED

Situation: I attempted to create a new GitHub repository named "how to earn money using ai" as you requested.
Problem: The `gh` command (GitHub CLI) was not found on your system. This means I cannot create a GitHub repository directly.

To proceed, you will need to install the GitHub CLI and authenticate it, or create the repository manually.

What would you like to do?
A: I will install GitHub CLI and authenticate it, then you can try again.
B: I will create the repository manually and provide you with the URL.
C: I'd like to do something else.
